# wp-mini-menu
> A WordPress plugin for a mini menu to access most common admin items when the admin bar is not active.

In most of our custom WordPress themes, we like to view our pages without the admin bar. Still, while developing or maintaining a website, we like to have access to some of the most common admin items. This tiny menu helps a bit.
