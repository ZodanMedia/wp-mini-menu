A mini menu to access most common admin items when te admin bar is not active


== Description ==

In most of our custom WordPress themes, we like to view our pages without the admin bar. Still, while developing or maintaining a website, we like to have access to some of the most common admin items. This tiny menu helps a bit.

= What does it do? =

* Show the WordPress "Edit post" action
* Show a link to the Dashboard
* Show a link to the WP Network (if available)
* Show a link to New posts (for public post types)
* Show a link to Menus, Widgets, Plugins and Users sections
* Show a link to ACF, Yoast SEO, WooCommerce and WPML (if available)
* Show custom links (to be added on the settings page)

This plugin is under active development. Any feature requests are welcome at [plugins@zodan.nl](plugins@zodan.nl)!



== Installation ==

= Install the Mini Menu from within WordPress =

1. Visit the plugins page within your dashboard and select ‘Add New’;
1. Search for ‘Mini Admin Menu’;
1. Activate the plugin from your Plugins page;
1. Go to ‘after activation’ below.

= Install manually = 

1. Unzip the Mini Admin Menu zip file
2. Upload the unzipped folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory;
3. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress;
4. Go to ‘after activation’ below.

2. Tick the boxes of the items you would like to show in the menu;

4. Save your settings and you’re done!



== Frequently asked questions ==

= Which plugins do you support by default? =

Right now, quite arbitrarily, we support WPML, ACF, Yoast SEO and WooCommerce. Just because these are plugins we access a lot during development.
But you can add your own through the settings page.
If you think a major plugin is missing by default, send us an email at [plugins@zodan.nl](plugins@zodan.nl).

= Do you have plans to improve the plugin =

Yes. We currently have on our roadmap:
* Possibility to order menu items
* Add roles per menu item
* Finish making stuff translatable
